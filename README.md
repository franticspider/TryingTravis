# TryingTravis
Learning how to set up Travis for a C++ github project

Following the tutorial at https://arne-mertz.de/2017/04/continuous-integration-travis-ci/

NB: I already had gitub and travis accounts, but I hadn't successfully linked them together

To add a repo to Travis, go to https://travis-ci.org/ and look in the left panel. Click on the `+` sign next to the My Repositories tab and turn the project you want to add to 'on' via the button down the right hand side

Next you'll need to clone the project locally so you can add files easily. *This isn't mentioned in the tutorial*

Now you can create the `main.cpp` and `.travis.yml` files as instructed
